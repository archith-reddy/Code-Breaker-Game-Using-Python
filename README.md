# Code-Breaker-Game-Using-Python
The system generates a random three digit code, the objective is to guess the code generated by the computer.

For each guess you make, the system provides you with these clues: Close (If one or more didgits are correct, here order is not important), Match (If one or more digits are correct, here order is important too), and Nope (None of the digits are correct).

Example:
         
        Generated Code - 146
         Guessed Code - 179 
         Clues: Match 
        
        Generated Code - 146
         Guessed Code - 781 
         Clues: Close
         
         
         Generated Code - 146
         Guessed Code - 927
         Clues: Nope
